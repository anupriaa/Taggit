Whether it is a website you like or thoughts rambling through your head, once you link them with Taggit, it will automatically parse, tag and contextualized that snippet of your life for future retrieval whenever you feel an itch in your brain to reminisce about a thought you can't fully recall.\r\n\r\nWhile this seems like a very expansive undertaking, the idea is pretty simple. Whenever you come across moment in your digital or analog lives that you wish to hold onto just a little bit longer...just link it with taggit, and carry on living the moment. Taggit will search for the relevant tags and save that snippet with the proper contextual information for future retrieval whenever you want to relive that moment.\r\n\r\nTaggit is similar to several other apps out there that essentially serve as virtual diaries or scrap books. Apps like evernote and pocket serve as repositories of your digital lives and allow both tagging and searching. However taggit attempts to take this one step further through automatic contextualizing and keywords linking. It also aims to serve a different end purpose: more than just an online directory for content that the user himself organizes, it is meant to be a dumping ground for random moments from day to day life that are sorted and managed transparently.\r\n\r\n<b>This Application uses the following technologies:</b>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.playframework.com/\">Play Framework 2.3.8</a>\r\n- <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\">Deployed on Heroku</a>\r\n\r\n##Current features\r\nThis application intends to provide two ways of linking a resource to Taggit.\r\n1.
